# password
A simple password generator 

This project makes use of 2 arrays. I pack the input into an array. This array's elements then get used as index values of the transpose table which then creates a new array that is also shifted according to its index. What have I learned:

- Take input and make an array thereof
- Shift an array according its index
- Elements represent a different value

To check how it works, open up developer tools, search in the code for the transpose table and keep focus!
